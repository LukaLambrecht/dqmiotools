# Tools for commissioning DQMIO datasets

In more detail, the tools in this folder can be used to check the available lumisections in DQMIO datasets, and compare those to the ones in the corresponding RAW datasets.
This gives a more relevant and reliable idea of the production completion than the monitoring tools from CMS computing.
Also, tools are available to assess the size of DQMIO datasets.

Note: these tools were mostly intended for internal usage at the time of the nanoDQMIO re-reco campaign, i.e. early 2023, using 2022 data (see [this twiki page](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PerLsDQMIO) for more information).
In principle, not expected to be used anymore since per-lumisection DQMIO is now merged into the regular DQMIO (including all productions, such as Express, Prompt and ReReco) and no dedicated re-reco is needed anymore to produce per-lumisection DQMIO datasets.
